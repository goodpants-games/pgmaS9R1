## Programming conventions
- Constants must be in `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Non-constant global variables must be in `PascalCase`.
- Avoid using globals.
  - The only module that should be exported to a global is batteries and
    sceneman. The remaining modules are not used frequently enough for them to
    need to be globals. (sceneman is an exception).
- Modules and classes must be in `PascalCase`.
- Use `snake_case` for everything else. `flatcase` is permitted if the name is
  short enough. (e.g. "scrw", "mousex" as opposed to "mouse_x")

## Misc. conventions
- File and directory names must be in `snake_case`.
